                    <h1>Best Multi-Purpose Foods</h1>
                    <p>Nutrition is crucial for maintaining a healthy lifestyle. However, identifying the most essential or effective nutrients can pose a challenge. Certain nutrient pairs are recognized for their synergistic effects, offering enhanced benefits when consumed together. Rather than focusing solely on traditional food combinations, this page highlights individual foods that naturally offer advantageous nutrient combinations. The data processing in this project considers the nutrient values per serving instead of the provided nutrient values per 100g, aiming for a more practical estimation of nutrient intake. I also removed 'Processed Foods' and 'Soups, Sauces, and Gravies' as the serving sizes <small class="citation">(Townsend JR, Kirby TO, Sapp PA, Gonzalez AM, Marshall TM, Esposito R.

                    <h2>Iron & Vitamin C</h2>
                    <p>The combination of iron and vitamin C enhances the absorption of iron from dietary sources, thereby preventing anemia and supporting overall energy levels. In addition to the well-known iron-rich beef, veal, and lamb products, it's worth mentioning that cabbage has also been identified as substantial sources of both iron and vitamin C.</p>
